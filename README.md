> A Flask-based plugin **framework**: bring scattered Python plugins and pure-frontend tools into one unified runtime —
> dynamically installable, hot-reloadable, permission-controlled. Self-written, self-maintained, runs only on your own machine.

## Why FlaskToolkit (Author's Story)

I have written a lot of "little things": sign-in scripts, scheduled tasks, file handlers, chart pages… Most are in Python, many are Flask pages with the frontend and backend in one, and quite a few are pure-frontend HTML. Each works well on its own, but they are scattered across folders — every time I wanted to add a feature, I had to reinvent login/auth, upload/download, page skeletons, and scheduled jobs from scratch.

What bothered me even more: more and more things that should stay lightweight were being pushed online — unusable offline, and quietly collecting my data. I did not want to register an account and accept a privacy policy just to use an internal mini tool. What I wanted were small programs running on my own computer (at most shared with a few people on a LAN).

So FlaskToolkit was born: a plugin **framework** — not another run-of-the-mill tools site — that packs my "private little apps", along with their capabilities, into one reusable and extensible foundation.

Over time it grew into what it is today:

- From single-file plugins grew **plugin packages (.zip)** — plugins ship together with their templates and static assets, install and go;
- Pure-frontend HTML tools can also be installed as **first-class citizens**, on equal footing with Python plugins;
- Large plugins can be split cleanly — **multi-template + helper modules + static assets**; one plugin can have its own sub-pages, utility modules, and style/script files (page routes with `page=True`);
- Unified three-level permissions, optional auth, audit logs, hot reload — save a page and it takes effect, no restart needed;
- Unified file transfer: **global upload-size ceiling (100MB, per-route overridable)** with pre-save streaming checks, Chinese-safe downloads (RFC 5987), download stats & Range resume;
- Added plugin-package integrity verification & signing, Factory Reset, backup/restore, startup self-check, plus a **331-assertion regression suite and GitHub Actions CI**.

To be honest, this framework is far from "production-grade". It is more of a "play for fun" project: standing on the shoulders of giants like Flask, APScheduler, and Werkzeug, and landing the parts I needed. That is also why its security model is bluntly simple — **installing a plugin means trusting its author**. It suits your own machine or a trusted LAN, not a public production environment.

My only principle: **need-driven, whatever is convenient**. So what you get is an out-of-the-box, low-barrier toolbox that lets you drop in tools whenever you want, with your data always in your own hands.

## What It Is

A Flask-based plugin **framework** (self-hosted runtime):

- Both **backend plugins (Python)** and **frontend tools (HTML packages)** can be dynamically installed / updated / uninstalled / enabled / disabled;
- Auth is an **optional plugin** — skip it for guest mode, install it for login / permission control;
- File-watching hot reload, changes take effect immediately;
- Built-in admin panel (dashboard / plugin management / logs / stats / system reset).

In one sentence: this is a **plugin framework** — a unified home for your local mini programs, plus a "foundation" you never have to rewrite.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser (local-only by default; set `FLASKTOOLKIT_HOST=0.0.0.0` for LAN use, see below).

On first run, install the built-in `auth` plugin to enable auth; default admin account `admin / admin123` (editable in `plugins/configs/auth.json`).

Want to feel the fun of "installing plugins" right away? Install the official examples:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt   # install_all.py needs requests
python examples/install_all.py                            # install all 6 official examples
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `FLASKTOOLKIT_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address; local-only by default, use `0.0.0.0` for LAN |
| `FLASKTOOLKIT_PORT` | auto-detect | Explicit port; falls back if occupied |
| `FLASKTOOLKIT_DEBUG` | off | Debug mode; do not enable in production |

## Official Examples

The [`examples/`](examples/README.md) directory ships with a set of one-click installable examples that demonstrate the full framework, and serve as starting templates for new plugin development:

| Example | Type | Highlights |
|---------|------|-----------|
| `hello_plugin` | Backend plugin | Lifecycle hooks, three-level permissions, config read/write, custom page |
| `scheduler_demo` | Backend plugin | APScheduler scheduled jobs (interval/cron) |
| `async_file_demo` | Backend plugin | Upload limits, async tasks, status polling, result download |
| `dependent_demo` | Backend plugin | Dependency declaration, cross-plugin calls |
| `multitool_demo` | Backend plugin | Large plugin multi-template: page routes, helper .py, static assets |
| `dashboard_demo` | Frontend tool | Admin permission, calls backend APIs, ECharts, static assets |

See [examples/README.md](examples/README.md).

## Tests & CI

`tests/` contains **18 scripts / 331 assertions** of regression tests (isolated-directory mode, no pollution of project files); GitHub Actions runs them automatically on Python 3.10 / 3.11 / 3.12, covering permissions, plugin-package / frontend-tool chains, uninstall manifests, Factory Reset, large-plugin multi-template page routing, file transfer (upload limits / Chinese-name downloads / Range), ops tools, etc.

## Known Limitations

- **Security model is "install a plugin = trust its author"**: plugins can execute arbitrary code; only install plugins from trusted sources.
- The framework leans toward "play for fun" utilities and is not hardened for adversarial public networks — **not recommended for public-facing production deployment**.
- For LAN use, set `FLASKTOOLKIT_HOST=0.0.0.0`, but pair it with the `auth` plugin and assess the risk yourself.
